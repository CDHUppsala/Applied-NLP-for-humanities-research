# Case Study 2: Literary Style

In this folder, materials can be found for the second case study included in the handbook chapter on literary style. The folder includes the notebook (`literary_style.ipynb`), the metadata file (`literary_style.csv`) and the corpus with the processed novels in CONLL format which are needed to execute the code (added soon). Due to copyright, only a selection of novels are shared here.

## How to use the script

Download the notebook, the corpus with the novels, and the metadata file and save them in a suitable place on your computer. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab or alternative. Add the paths to the folders in the notebook where ´yourpath´ is written. Now you can start executing the code blocks in the notebook.
